# Why are we doing this?

With the recent Ethereum switch from the Proof-of-Work to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism - Golem Foundation, the organization developing Hexagon, made the decision to become a validator in the network. The Foundation will stake 100 000 ETH to secure the network and help it reach a consensus.

In return for staking its Ether and becoming a validator, the Foundation will receive a steady stream of continuous rewards directly from the protocol. Part of the staking rewards will be transferred to the Hexagon community, whose members will decide through individual actions and community polls how these funds will be distributed.

Community members will be able to choose between claiming part of the reward for themselves and donating it to eligible public goods causes.

In the process, Golem Foundation will gather useful empirical evidence on how users participate in decentralized governance. This evidence will inform our search for effective [decentralized governance solutions](), and further the development of the [User-Defined Organization]() project.

Participation in the Hexagon community will be open to any person who holds GLM tokens (an ERC-20 token, native to the Golem Network) and stakes a certain minimum amount of their tokens into the Hexagon contract.

You will be able to stake as low as 1 GLM, but to claim rewards and vote in the Hexagon community polls, you will have to stake at least 100 GLMs for one epoch (the length of which is currently set at 90 days).

Staking in this context means time-locking your GLM. The tokens staked by Hexagon users will not be pooled together with other users’ funds, and the whole GLM staking set-up is non-custodial. Users will be able to withdraw their tokens at any time. However, if they do so before the end of a given epoch, they will not be able to claim any rewards nor participate in community decisions regarding the distribution of funds.

The amount of ETH rewards transferred by the Golem Foundation to Hexagon will be determined by the fraction of the entire GLM supply staked by Hexagon users. The more GLMs are staked into the Hexagon contract, the higher the amount of the Foundation’s staking rewards that will be turned over to the Hexagon community for distribution.
