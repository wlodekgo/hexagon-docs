# Using the app

This user guide refers to a Hexagon prototype that is currently under development.

Not all the functionalities listed here have been implemented already, and changes to the UX/UI design are still possible, based on the feedback we receive from early testers. 

The alpha version of the app with limited but quickly expanding functionality has been deployed to the Görli Testnet. If you would like to help us test the app…

### Getting started

The first thing you need to do after launching the app is to connect your wallet. At the moment only Metamask is supported, but we are working on integrating other popular wallets as well.

To connect your Metamask wallet click on the Connect your wallet button on the top of the screen and follow the instructions in your wallet.

Once you have connected your wallet, you will have to stake some GLM in the Earn tab. GLM is an ERC-20 Ethereum-based token native to the [Golem Network](). If you do not have any GLM you can acquire them at various [exchanges]() and on [Uniswap]().

You can stake as low as 1 GLM but to be able to claim user rewards and allocate your funds to eligible projects, you need to stake at least 100 GLM for one 90-day epoch.

The more GLM you stake, the higher your user reward, and the more funds you can allocate to your favorite projects. Check Hexagon’s [Technical Outline]() if you want to know more about how we calculate rewards and matched funds.

Hexagon's GLM staking mechanism is non-custodial. You are in full control of your funds. You can unstake your GLM at any time. Please note, however, that if you unstake your GLMs before the current epoch ends you will not be able to claim your user rewards or allocate any funds to your favorite projects.

You can access your Hexagon-connected wallet at any time by clicking on a tile showing your Ethereum address at the top of the screen.

The Wallet view allows you to check your connected wallet balances in ETH, GLM, and their fiat equivalents in the currency of your choice. The view also displays your rewards budget, as well as pending allocations and withdrawals.

The Wallet view also allows you to disconnect your wallet from Hexagon at any time.

### The main app views

The app has 5 main views, which you can access by clicking at the appropriate tab at the bottom of the screen:
**Projects** - where you can scroll through the list of projects to which you can donate in the current epoch;
**Allocate** - which allows you to allocate your user rewards in part or full to projects you shortlisted;
**Metrics** - shows you a range of stats about the current and previous epochs to help you make allocation decisions;
**Earn** - where you can edit your GLM stake, withdraw your user rewards in ETH, and check current and estimated reward stats;
**Settings** - allows you to access various app settings. The main toggle allows you to choose ETH or a selected fiat as a primary display currency.

### Allocate your Hexagon funds

To find out more about the causes which were shortlisted by the Hexagon community as potential donation recipients in the current epoch, click on the Projects tab at the bottom of the screen. (Information on the eligibility criteria and on how users can submit a project can be found [here]()).

You can scroll through the list of eligible projects and see how many funds have been already allocated to them by Hexagon community members. If you would like to know more about a project, click on it to read a more detailed description and to see the list of the latest donations Hexagon community members have made to it during the current epoch.

If you find a project you would like to support with your User Rewards, click on the Add to Allocate button right next to it.

Currently, you can only choose one project to which you would like to allocate some part of your user rewards, but we are working on making it possible to split your donation between several projects.

Projects you shortlisted for allocation will appear in the Allocate tab.

In the Allocate view, you can see the projects you added to your shortlist as well as...

Click on a shortlisted project to decide how much you would like to donate to it. Once you've chosen the correct amount click Done, and then Allocate. You will be shown an overview of your allocated decisions in the current epoch. You will be able to Confirm your decision or Edit your allocations further.

### Staking and withdrawing funds

The Earn tab allows you to edit your GLM stake, withdraw your user rewards in ETH, and check the current and estimated reward stats.

Your Current Epoch Stake will be displayed there. By clicking on the "Edit GLM Stake" button you can change the amount of tokens you would like to stake. Choose the amount you would like to stake and click Done. You can now approve your stake.

Once you've approved your stake you will be shown a History view where you will see your stakes, funds you allocated to different projects, and user rewards you withdraw.

You can change your stake at any moment, please keep in mind, however, that:
- to be eligible for user rewards and to be able to donate to your preferred projects you have to stake at least 100 GLMs for a whole epoch;
- if you lower your stake your user reward will be calculated in proportion to the smaller amount.

### Metrics view

In the Metrics view you can check the following information:
- when the current epoch allocation period ends;
- the total amount of ETH staked by the Golem Foundation and GLM staked by Hexagon users;
- the fraction of GLM staked by Hexagon users in relation to the Total GLM supply;
- the current value of ETH rewards transferred by Golem Foundation to Hexagon, and the value of users and matched donations to community chosen projects; 
- how much money has been claimed by community users versus donated to eligible projects;
- information on the amount of GLM tokens that are unclaimed and unallocated at the end of the epoch or allocated to projects below the cutoff threshold.
